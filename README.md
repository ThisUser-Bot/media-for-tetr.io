# Media For tetr.io
Images that gets used for my custom backgrounds in tetr.io, which you should check the game out. Used to host them on Discord, but that was until the school network didn't allow images from Discord to show. So it's now hosted on GutHub.

I do not own the backgrounds used except for one, all rights goes to their respective owners.
